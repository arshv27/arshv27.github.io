Iâ€™m an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, a non-profit building AI solutions for Social Impact. I have a keen interest in using Deep Learning for Computer Vision solutions that can deliver long-term social impact. I am currently exploring multi-modal approaches for AI applications in Healthcare.

At Wadhwani AI, I am the lead associate on medical imaging solutions on Radiology and Dermatology. I am excited by the prospect of using rigorous academic methods to solve novel problems from scratch and sharpen my conceptual intuition. My goal is to widen access and revolutionise healthcare through AI. I have had the chance to visit hospitals and rural clinics to interact with both the intended end users (radiologists, radiographers, and medical officers) and the beneficiaries (patients), which has provided me with a deeper appreciation of the challenges of deploying real-world medical AI solutions. Through close interactions with researchers like Dr. Makarand Tapaswi and Dr. Alpan Raval, I have flourished as a researcher and refined my skills in carving out problem statements, designing experiments, conducting thorough evaluations, and communicating the results effectively and clearly. This adds another dimension to my rich experience of field interactions and clinical deployments in a developing country.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in 2021 from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. During this time, I worked on building the Scene Text Recognition module as a part of my B.Tech Project (Thesis) in a project on building a Mobility Assistant for the Visually Impaired (MAVI) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
