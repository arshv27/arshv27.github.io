I am an applied machine learning engineer and researcher focused on building AI systems that move from research prototypes to real-world impact. My work spans the full ML lifecycle — from data ingestion and engineering to model training, alignment, evaluation, and production deployment. I have strong technical depth across deep learning, reinforcement learning, LLMs, and agent-based systems, and I am comfortable operating across modeling, infrastructure, and product boundaries to deliver scalable, reliable AI solutions. I take end-to-end ownership of problems, move quickly from idea to execution, and thrive in fast-paced, high-ownership environments where engineering decisions directly shape impact.

In 2024, I joined Carnegie Mellon University to pursue my M.S. in Robotics, where I am advised by Jeff Schneider. My research focuses on learning-based planning and Active Search for real-time robotic systems. Specifically, I work on training policies that enable robots to reason and act under uncertainty within strict latency constraints — bridging the gap between theoretical reinforcement learning and deployable robotic decision-making systems.

Previously, I worked as an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, where I built and deployed production-grade deep learning systems for large-scale healthcare applications. I led development across the end-to-end ML pipeline — from messy clinical data ingestion and curation to modeling, evaluation, and integration into national health platforms. One of the systems I helped build, a chest X-ray abnormality detection model, now serves over 2 million patients annually on India’s national digital diagnosis platform. I also developed a tuberculosis screening model supporting diagnosis across more than 3 million presumptive cases each year. This experience strengthened my ability to design AI systems that operate under real-world constraints — limited data quality, infrastructure variability, and the need for rigorous evaluation before deployment.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi in 2021. Outside of research and engineering, I enjoy strategy-heavy games and puzzles and have been active in chess, math, and poker communities at both CMU and IIITD.
