I’m an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, a non-profit building AI solutions for Social Impact. I have a keen interest in using Deep Learning for Computer Vision solutions that can deliver long-term social impact.

At Wadhwani AI, I am the lead associate on medical imaging solutions on Radiology and Dermatology. My goal is to widening access and revolutionise healthcare through AI.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in 2021 from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. During this time, I worked on building the Scene Text Recognition module as a part of my B.Tech Project (Thesis) as a part of the project on building a Mobility Assistant for the Visually Impaired (MAVI) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
