Hi and welcome! I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Machine Learning and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Dr. Jeff Schneider. My research focuses on learning-based planning and decision-making for real-time robotic systems. I have a keen interest in using Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative AI for solving complex real-world problems.

Previously, I worked as an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, where I deployed production-grade deep learning systems for medical imaging. One of my proudest achievements was building a chest X-ray abnormality detection model that now serves over 2 million patients annually on India's national digital diagnosis platform. I also developed a TB screening model aiding diagnosis in over 3 million presumptive cases each year. My time at Wadhwani AI helped me bridge the gap between rigorous academic methods and real-world clinical deployments.

I completed my undergraduate studies in 2021 from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD). Outside of my academic and professional life, I love playing games and strategy puzzles, having been an active member of the Chess, Math, and Poker clubs at both CMU and IIITD!
